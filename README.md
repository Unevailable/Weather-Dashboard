# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is the Module 6 project. It uses APIs to create a weather calendar page.

## Installation

I created a repository through Git Hub. After that, I went into Gitbash to create all the necessary files for the project, JS, CSS, and HTML. moving forward I added the API to my javaScript and started the Skelton code for my page. I used A.I to help me give me an idea on how to start working on this project. After building up the JavaScript and HTML I worked on my CSS to make the page look nice to the user. Lastly, I pushed the updates to my GitHub repo.

## Usage

The usage of this site is for users to be able to see the weather of the current day and the next 5 days. They can also check the weather within other cities.
